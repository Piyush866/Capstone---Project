# Capstone---Project
I am developing a capstone machine learning project called DocAssist using Python and the Flask framework. DocAssist utilizes machine learning techniques to enhance document-related tasks. The project involves implementing functionalities through Flask to create a user-friendly web application that streamlines document processing.
